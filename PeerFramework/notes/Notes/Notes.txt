Informing the main server I'm creating a mesh:
1. The UDP communication module must be authorized by main server
2. A method is triggered in the mediator. This method sends a message to
   Main server asking for a SessionKey. 
3. The server sends back a SessionKey and Id to the Station.
4. The station initializes a Mesh and sends the server a confirmation
   plus the SessionKey.
5. The server saves the advertice data.

Joining a Mesh:
There's two ways of joining a mesh: 

1. Matchmaking
	- Station sends a matchmaking ticket to the main server.
	- Main server finds a session that's suitable for the ticket
	- Main servers sends the Host Data
2. Private Code
	- Station sends a MeshId to the server
	- Server finds the data for the Host
	- Main server sends the data to the client
	
After any of the two proccesses are finished a Mesh data network event
is fired in the joining station.
Based on the mediator in use a NAT Traversal function will be fired to contact
the mesh owner or directly stablish a connection via Station service.
